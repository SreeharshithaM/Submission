Simple User and Account Management System

This system manages users, their roles, and permissions, along with bank accounts spread across multiple banks and branches. Users can be normal or bank users and may have multiple accounts in different banks. Accounts can be of different types such as Savings, Current, or Term Deposits, and can be operated by minors or Power of Attorney (POA).

Key features include:
- Multiple banks and branches management.
- Accounts in multiple currencies (for NRI accounts).
- Role-based access control for users.
- Operations such as deposit, withdrawal (with limits), account closure (limited), balance checking (limited), and account operation (limited).
- REST APIs to create, read, update, and delete users and accounts.
- Secure authentication using JWT with RS256 signing (optional bonus).
- Data migration and proper documentation.
