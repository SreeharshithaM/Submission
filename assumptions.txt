Assumptions for Simple User and Account Management System:

1. Each user is uniquely identified by a User ID.
2. A user can have multiple roles, and each role has specific permissions.
3. Each bank has multiple branches identified by a branch code.
4. Accounts are uniquely identified by an Account Number.
5. Account types include Saving, Current, and Term Deposits.
6. Term Deposits are treated as special accounts with fixed maturity periods.
7. Accounts can be operated by minors or POA, with some operations restricted based on age or permissions.
8. Currency codes follow ISO 4217 standard (e.g., USD, INR).
9. Withdrawal and account closure are subject to limits based on account type and user role.
10. Users must authenticate before accessing any account operation.
11. Data migration will use SQL Server and support scripts for populating initial data.
12. APIs adhere to RESTful standards with endpoints /users, /accounts, and optionally /banks.
13. No executable, binary, or compiled files are part of the submission.
14. Extra security is provided by implementing JWT with RS256 signatures.
